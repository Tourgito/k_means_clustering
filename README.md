# Clustering with K-Means, using Spark

Team Project for the purposes of Big Data course,
University of Macedonia, Greece

Finding the K-means in a dataset, which contains coordination for a 5-dimensioanl space. Apache Spark was used, where a cluster of nodes was build to calculate the k-means. The process was run multiple times, where in each the cluster had a different number of nodes. Finally, the duration of every execution was written down and printed to a diagram to analyze and compare them.
